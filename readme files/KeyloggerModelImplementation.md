# Can refer this blog for creating the model and to see how it works:

## Blog: 
https://towardsdatascience.com/anomaly-detection-for-dummies-15f148e559c1

## Jupyter Notebook: 
https://github.com/susanli2016/Machine-Learning-with-Python/blob/master/Anomaly_Detection_for_Dummies.ipynb [Public Repo]

## Blog on Pyod: 
https://analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/02/outlier-detection-python-pyod/

Pyod is nothing just a library which has total 20 libraries and can be used for anomaly detection.

We can use this in our project to find a suitable model that fits our use case and provides accurate results.
